Intestinal Organoids,Homo sapiens,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon_9606 ,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,NCBITaxon,NCBITaxon_2697049,primary gut epithelial stem cells,SARS-CoV-2,Unsupervised transmission electron microscopy,hSIOs 60hpi SARS-CoV-2,12448_J1HR_Mesh001.tif,derived,"Unsupervised transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Faas et al., J.Cell Biol. 2012) was performed on selected highly infected samples. Figure 4 shows two hSIOs, selected from 42 imaged hSIOs, 60 h post SARS-CoV-2 infection. These differ in the state of infection: whereas the cellular organization within organoid 1 was still intact (Fig. 4A entire organoid; intermediate magnification B-D;  high  magnification E-K), many disintegrated cells can be seen in organoid 2 (Fig. 4 Bottom (Fig. 4L entire organoid; intermediate magnification 4M-O;  high magnification 4P-R). Viral particles of 80-120 nm occurred in the lumen of the organoid (4I), at the basolateral (4J) and apical side (4K) of enterocytes. The double-membrane vesicles which are the subcellular site of viral replication (Knoops et al., PLoS 2008) are visualized in Figure 4E and 4P. The nuclei in both organoids differed from nuclei in mock-infected organoids by a slightly rounder shape. The nuclear contour index (McNutt et al., Cancer 1981) was 4.0+/-0.5 vs 4.3+/-0.5 for control set. There was more heterochromatin (4N), and one or two dense nucleoli in the center (4O). "
